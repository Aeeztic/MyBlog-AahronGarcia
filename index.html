    <h1>Introduction to Computing</h1>
    <p id="name">Aahron Jamez Garcia - BSCS</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Computers</strong>have always been considered a huge advancement toward humanity's intellectual evolution. It is a tool that was made for people to lead comfortable lives by mechanizing any intellectual activities that could be imagined. As each era passes by, humans advance with new discoveries. But if we look back into our history books before all this technology, the idea and use of computing and programming started differently.</p>
        
    <h2>Brier History of Evolution in computing:
    </h2>

    <h3>Analytical Engine - 1837</h3>
    <p>Designed by Charles Cabbage who's referred to as the "Father of Computers" the Analytical Engine was a Machinal computer that was supposed to be able to perform calculations. Though never completed the concept introduced the idea of a programmable machine capable of Complex Calculations

    <h3>Analytical Engine - 1837</h3>
    <p>Designed by Charles Cabbage who's referred to as the "Father of Computers" the Analytical Engine was a Machinal computer that was supposed to be able to perform calculations. Though never completed the concept introduced the idea of a programmable machine capable of Complex Calculations</p>
    
    <h3>The Turing Machine - 1936</h3>
    <p>Introduced by the English Mathematician Alan Turing the Turing machine was a mathematical machine that was capable of reducing the logical structure of any computing device to its essentials.</p>
    
    <h3 id="comp">The Complex Number Calculator (CNC) - 1940</h3>
    <p>The Complex Number Calculator designed by the Mathematician George Stibitz was considered as the forerunner of the digital computers. Presented during the American Mathematical Society conference the invention created the first example of remote access computing operation by inputting problems through a teleprinter.</p>
    
    <h3 id="elect">Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer(ENIAC) - 1943-1946</h3>
    <p>Constructed by by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly the ENIAC was accepted by many as the first ever Completed and Functional digital computer. It was a powerful calculating device generally used for computing values for artillery range tables during WW2.
    </p>

    <h3>The First Super Computer - 1964</h3>
    <p>The first ever super computer  developed by Control Data Corp was a machine that was designed to handle complex scientific calculations, with the speed of 3million floating-point operations per second it was considered as the fastest of the time.
    </p>

    <h3 id="wind">First Windows Operating System - 1985</h3>
    <p>During 1985 Microsoft introduced the first ever version of Windows 1.0. What made this release notable is because windows heavily relied on the use of mouses where in that time people only saw the mouse as an input device.
    </p>
    
    <h3>World Wide Web - 1989</h3>
    <p>Created by Tim Berners-Lee the world wide web started as a normal information sharing platform through researchers and scientists but its worth was recognized and is now shaped into the web we use now.</p>
    
    <h3 id="change">Influential Figures :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Ada Lovelace(1815- 1852 )</strong>-    referred to as the inventor of programming</li>
        <li><strong>Charles Cabbage(1791 – 1871)</strong>- Recognized as the Father Of Computing</li>
        <li><strong>Alan turning (1912–1954)</strong>-     recognized by developing the Turing machine</li>
        <li><strong>Grace Hopper (1906–1992)</strong>-     recognized as the developer of the first compiler</li>
        <li><strong>John Von Neumann  (1903–1957)</strong>-recognized from his proposal von Neumann architecture</li>

    </ol>
    <h1>Introduction of IT Basics</h1>
    <p>Information Technology is a wide field, it refers to different areas of study within the field of technology. Used by the different industries IT is utilized to access information and business operations. Companies nowadays uses IT to manage and process data as its efficient and Useful.</p>
    
    <h2 id="change">Hardware components</h2>

    <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
    <p> Referred to as the brain of a computer. The CPU or also called as the central processor handles the execution of the programs and interprets the data that comes the input devices and sends to the output devices.</p>
    
    <h3 id="access">Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
    <p>The ram is also an important part of computer as it is typically used to store data. It allows the CPU to access data faster. The more ram your computer has the more task its capable of handling without slowing it down.</p>

    <h3>Storage Devices (HDD/SDD)</h3>
    <p>The storage devices is where data is permanently stored. There are 2 storage devices for your computer which are The Hard Disk Drive and the Solid State Drive. Both storage devices differs from each other, HDD uses a spinning disk and the SDD uses flash memory.</p>

    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
    <p> The motherboard contains the main circuit of your computer that's why its often referred as the Heart of a computer. It is the main connection that allow other part of the computer to communicate. </p>

    <h3>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h3>
    <p>The power supply unit power storage of a computer.  It provides the computer the necessary about of electricity to function the device. Its also important as helps keep the electrical flow of the computer and help keep it stable.
    </p>

    <h3>Graphic Processing Unit(GPU)</h3>
    <p>The GPU ensures the rendering of images, videos, and animations of your computer. The GPU handles a heavy task as its responsible for processing visuals for your computer. The GPU is also important for heavy task such as gaming, video, editing, and other graphic-intensive applications.
    </p>

    <h2 id="change2">Software</h2>
    <p>Software is a computer program that provides a set of instructions to execute a user’s commands and tell the computer what to do. Software is also a collection of data that are used to run machines and perform execution of systems for the end-user.</p>
    
    <h3 id="change">Types of Software's</h3>
     <ol>
         <li><strong>System Software </strong>- refers to operating systems like Windows, IOS, macOS where it directly operates the computer hardware and ensures the functionality to the users as well as to the other software.</li>
         <li><strong>Application software </strong>- refers to software that performs its functionality according to its purpose. Unlike System software where it directly involves into hardware to provide functionality the Application software operates its designed task to the user.        </li>
     </ol>
     <h2 id="change2">Networking</h2>
     <p>Networking refers to process of connecting devices such as a computer to share sources and information. Networking is an efficient way of exchanging data across different platforms. It is widefield used by Enterprises that consist of many forms such as building and maintaining networks. </p>
     
     <h3>Key Components</h3>

     <ul>
    <li><strong>Network Devices</strong> - Hardware components that allow connection between a computer and the internet network. </li>
    <li><strong>Links</strong> - It can be defined as a chain that allows information travel between devices</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Protocols</strong> - Are set of rules that devices follow when sharing information</li>
    <li><strong>Network Defense</strong> - Are measures taken to secure the content and privacy of the data and information </li>

     </ul>

     <h2>Role of IT in Modern Organizations</h2>
     <p>IT plays a big role in todays modernization as most organizations in this era are reliant to the efficiency IT brings. IT is innovative at it involves multiple branches such as communication, Sharing of Information, and Network Management. These are only some of areas IT is involved in. Organizations nowadays uses IT to its full extent as boost production and improve the workflow with its innovations. IT is vital and as each year passes by IT will continue to stay Important in the field of technology.
